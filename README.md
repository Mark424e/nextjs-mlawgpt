# MieritzAI - AI-Powered Legal Chatbot

*Developed as part of my final bachelor's project in web development.*

MieritzAI is an AI-powered chatbot developed for Mieritz Advokatfirma. The project leverages technologies like **LangChain.js**, **OpenAI API**, and **Datastax Astra DB** to deliver accurate and relevant legal information based on the firm's website [Mlaw.dk](https://mlaw.dk) and general legal knowledge. This project represents the culmination of my bachelor's degree in web development, showcasing the integration of modern technologies to solve a company's challenge.

## Introduction

This project was created as part of my final bachelor's project in web development at Zealand Institute of Business & Technology. The aim was to design and develop an AI-driven chatbot to improve the accessibility of legal information for clients and staff at Mieritz Advokatfirma.

MieritzAI uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to combine generative AI models with precise context retrieved from the firmâ€™s website. By delivering an intuitive and functional solution, the project bridges the gap between advanced technology and the practical needs of the legal field. This work highlights my ability to research, design, implement, and deploy a scalable application that addresses specific user needs.

## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Implements vector-based search to retrieve precise information.
- **Markdown Formatting:** Generates readable and structured responses using headings, bullet points, and highlights.
- **Real-time Chat:** Streams responses dynamically for a smooth conversational experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive UI with prompt suggestions for easy interaction.
- **Scalable Hosting:** Deployed on Vercel for fast and reliable performance.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** LangChain.js, OpenAI API
- **Database:** Datastax Astra DB
